# Docker Installation Guides

## 1. Prerequsites

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl apt-transport-https ca-certificates  software-properties-common
# For older versions...
sudo apt install gnupg-agent
```

## 2. Setup Docker Repository

```bash
# To get your ubuntu version
echo $(lsb_release -cs)
# Output: Bionic, Xenial or Focal
```

Sometimes, docker is not available for your version, so use previous LTS version

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# THIS
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
# OR
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"

```

Your system is now ready for Docker installation.

## 3. Install Docker on Ubuntu

```bash
# Update packages before installing docker
sudo apt update
# Make sure we are installing from Docker Repo not the ubuntu repo...
apt-cache policy docker-ce

sudo apt install docker-ce
# OR: Use a specific version of docker based on Linux Version
apt list -a docker-ce
sudo apt install docker-ce=5:18.09.6~3-0~ubuntu-bionic
# To prevent the Docker package from being automatically updated, mark it as held back:
sudo apt-mark hold docker-ce
```

## 4. Sudo Privelge for docker

By default, the docker command can only be run the root user or by a user in the docker group, which is automatically created during Docker’s installation process. If you attempt to run the docker command without prefixing it with sudo or without being in the docker group, you’ll get an output like this:

```bash
Output
docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is the docker daemon running on this host?.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
# Apply new group membership without logging out
su - ${USER}
```

Confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:

```bash
id -nG
# Output
# sammy sudo docker
```
